Just something cool and random!

# How to Run
- `cd` into `src/server` and run the server.py (You'll most likely need to install the deps in `reqs.txt`)
  - And `python server.py`
- Run the OSX app from `src/detector/osx/exported` OR `build` your own if you don't trust mines ðŸ™ƒ
  - Once the OSX app is running, you should see it in the status bar as an opaque dot *(osx didn't like my selected icon)*
  - Making sure the server.py is running, click `Connect` to connect the OSX app to the WebSocket server
- With the above steps executed properly, cross your fingers and visit `http://localhost:8888`
- Cast the window onto the TV or another separate screen and work on stuff and enjoy the tree growing to life.
